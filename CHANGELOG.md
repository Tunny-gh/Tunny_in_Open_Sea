### Added

- Display of estimated remaining time during optimization run.
- In-memory optimization mode.

- Support Journal storage.
  - Since saving to the sqlite storage format that had been used up to now sometimes resulted in errors during optimization, a different storage format was supported.
- Checkbox to toggle whether results are shown in the UI in Realtime.
  - There was a problem that the display of results on the UI in Realtime, which was added in v0.6, caused the optimization speed to gradually slow down.

### Changed

- Real-time display of trial number, best value, and Hypervolume in the UI.
- Created UI to set where to save optimization result files.
- SQLite handling in C#
  - Optimize result handling more smooth some case.
  - Previously, it used to read and handle python, which was sometimes slow, but now it calls SQLite directly from CS.
- Only non-dominated trial plot in pareto front.
- Boolean to skip the behavior of checking if the python library is installed in settings.
  - For some reason, the installer may be launched every time even if it is installed, so it can be forcibly skipped in the settings.
- FishEgg component
  - It is now possible to specify an individual of any variable and have it evaluated in the optimization first and foremost, rather than just setting up a variable completely by the sampler when conducting the optimization.
- Warn start CMA-ES support
  - The warm start CMA-ES setting has been added to the CMA-ES settings so that the information from the previous trials can be used.

### Changed

- When there are more than 10 params, the value of "Omit_values" is used instead of "params" to improve the visibility of the ParetoFront plot.
- Default name of optimization result file changed from "Tunny_Opt_Result.db" to "Fish.db".
- Easy-to-understand UI for creating study.
  - Study Create, Continue, and Copy are now clearly separated in the UI.
